        """Analyze this story for cinematic sound design. Extract audio cues with precise timing based on reading speed.

Story: "{story_text}"

Reading Speed: {speed_wps} words per second
Total Story Words: Count the words in the story
Total Duration (ms): Calculate as (total_words / {speed_wps}) * 1000

For each sound, you MUST provide:
- audio_class: detailed sound description for SoundGen AI
- audio_type: SFX (short sounds), AMBIENCE (background), or MUSIC (emotional)
- word_index: position (0-based) where the sound should start in the story
- start_time_ms: EXACT start time in milliseconds. Calculate as: (word_index / {speed_wps}) * 1000
- duration_ms: EXACT duration in milliseconds that YOU decide based on:
  * SFX: Decide duration (500-3000ms) based on the specific sound - a single bark might be 800ms, footsteps might be 2000ms, a door slam might be 1200ms
  * AMBIENCE: Decide duration based on story context - how long should this ambience play? Calculate from word_index to where it should end (next scene change, next AMBIENCE, or story end)
  * MUSIC: Decide duration based on emotional arc - how long should this musical element play? Consider the emotional moment and when it should fade (typically 2000-10000ms)
- weight_db: volume adjustment (-10.0 to 5.0, use 6.0 for "loud")

CRITICAL: You MUST provide a specific duration_ms value for EVERY audio cue. Do not leave it to be calculated later. Think about:
- For SFX: How long does this specific sound naturally last?
- For AMBIENCE: When does the scene/environment change in the story?
- For MUSIC: When does the emotional moment peak and fade?

Timing Calculation Rules:
1. start_time_ms = (word_index / {speed_wps}) * 1000 (round to nearest integer)
2. duration_ms = YOUR DECISION based on story context and sound type - provide the exact value
3. For overlapping sounds of the same type (e.g., two AMBIENCE cues), calculate when the first should end (typically when the second starts)
4. Ensure start_time_ms + duration_ms does not exceed total_duration_ms
5. Be precise - your duration_ms values will be used directly without modification

Try keeping as few Audio Cues as possible, not more than 3-4 Audio Cues.

Return ONLY a JSON array with these exact fields:
[
  {{"audio_class": "detailed sound description", "audio_type": "SFX|AMBIENCE|MUSIC", "word_index": 0, "start_time_ms": 0, "duration_ms": 2000, "weight_db": 0.0}}
]
